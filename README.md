## Introduction

This is my 4th project at code institute.This is restaurant website designed to display to the customers and allow them to make a booking and edit,view and delete the booking.In this website customers need to login or register on the website for booking, otherwise they can't see any booking and the website will take them on login page.This website deployed on heroku.

## User Experience

### Ideal User Demographic
* New users.
* Current users.

### User Stories

#### New users :

* For new/potential user, I have included all the information about the restaurant on one page.
* As a admin user, I can login website to the access the site's backend.
* As a admin user, I can update,delete and accept or reject the reservation.
* As a new/potential user, I can login or register on website to view or edit my bookings.
* As a new/potential user, I can see Breakfat,Lunch and Dinner menu seprately.


#### Current Users :
- As a current user, I can login my account.
- As a current user, I can Edit,View and Cancel my bookings.
- As a current user, I can check my previous booking status.
- As a current user, I can contact to the restaurant regarding my current booking information.
- As a current user, I can see all the new updates about the menu.

## Target

- On the website home page I have added a big background image about the food serving in the resturant, This image push people to come in the restaurant.
- On the website home page I have added a video clip about the restautant service and food, so that people can see everything about the restaurant before book a table.

#### Structure
In this website i used five apps:

1. Aboutus - restaurant history, chefs
2. Menu - menu display
3. Reservation - reservations enquiries & customer management
4. Home - Information of all the pages
5. Contact - users feedback

### Databases

The menu, aboutus and reservation apps require databases to store information so I have built 8 custom models. 

#### Menu
In the menu app i created two models names Meals & Category, these are two models that provide all the information required to display the items as part of the restaurant's menu. Each item has a name, description, price and for how many people.

This model is following this flow diagram:
![](/assets/readme-file/menu-diagram.png)

#### Reservation
There are 3 models in reservation app, Customer, Table & Reservation.These 3 models allow for customer details to be stored, reservation enquiries to be made & managed & also enable availability checks whilst the user is enquiring. 

For each reservation, there will be a customer & table assigned to it. The customer is assigned during the enquiry process and the tables are manage in the backend by the admin user. This model only works if user is login or registerd. Logged in users will have their details with the user email address as this is how they are located in the customer model.

The tables model is used for checking the availablity of the tables in the resturant. This process used by backend admin user, Admin user checks if there is avaiable table in the restaurant then he accept user table request according to the avaliabilty.

This model is following this flow diagram:
![](/assets/readme-file/reservation-diagram.png)

#### Aboutus
There are 3 models in aboutus app, AboutUs, Why_Choose_Us and Chef. AboutUs model is used for display the history of the restaurant with image.Why_Choose_Us model is created for show the 3 blocks, One is to read about out staff, Second is to about fresh food and the last one is read about our food quality.Chef model is used for show the information about our chef with chef image, name and social accounts.

This model is following this flow diagram:

 ## Design

 ### Colour Schema
 * I used four colours for the background and content, which are white, yellow, black and dark grey. I have also used a small amount of red for cancel the booking button.
* I chose all the colours I used from [theme waGon](https://themewagon.com/theme-tag/restaurant-template/) website.


#### Typography
* I selected the font I used  from the [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) website and linked it with my Css file.
* I used three font style system-ui,-apple-system,"Segoe UI",Roboto,"Helvetica Neue",Arial,"Noto Sans","Liberation Sans",sans-serif.

* I have used the font Sans-serif for backup in instances where if the correct link isnâ€™t provided to the css3 file, a font type is still available. If this occurs and the Google font does not work the backup font sans-serif will always work.

#### Imagery
* The images used in this website play vital role in the user experience of the website.
* The images shown on the website have been selected to convience customer to come in the resaurant.
* Image is downloaded free from the [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/gym%20and%20fitness/) website.


#### Skeleton
 - I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jCwcpxiv4ugqY8XK812AA8/Restaurant?node-id=0%3A1) Wireframe for website.

## Bugs
* one bug is when user send email, Contact form shows a error (Network is unreachable) with SMTP. It is working with (backend console).I tried to find out the solution on slack, stackoverflow and on goole but i coundn't get any solution.

## Issue Left
* Getting error when i try to send email with SMTP.

## Other Features
* The logo is linked to the home page when the user will click on the logo it will take them to the home page.
* On the form page, navigation bar and email have a hover option. When the user will hover their mouse over it, it will show a different colour. This makes it easier to understand for the user that this is clickable link.


### Feature Left to Implement

* Customer can pay bill only with debit, credit card or paypal.The reason why didn't implement this is because I need to use third party libaries for this but this project only uses reservation.

## Testing
The testing process can be found [here](assets/testing-file/testing.md)

## Deployment

### Github Pages
To deploy a Django application, The following options were used:
1. Click the `Use This Template` button.
2. Add a repository name and description.
3. Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
4. To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
5. When you want to open your project you can go in github and click on your repository then click on gitpod, or you can open with gitpod workspace as well.
6. when you change or write down new things you have to commit your work in github, use the following commands to make your commits:
   * `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    * `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    * `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

### Heroku Pages
This site was deploy via Heroku.

This project was developed using a template provide by code institute however the template was upgraded to improve its functionality, which you can see in the commit.

To deploy this project on Heroku I used followed these steps:

1. [Login](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) into Heroku.

2. In the main Heroku dashboard select â€˜Newâ€™in the top right corner.

3. In the drop down, menu select â€˜Create New Appâ€™.

4. Give a name related your project. I gave hangman-games to my project.

5. When you see green text with your project name then press â€˜create appâ€™button.

6. From the dashboard select â€˜settingâ€™option.

7. After select setting option scroll down in the config setting. Select the config vars section This will display the current config vars for the app, there should be nothing already there.

8. After config var select Buildpacks option which is located under the config vars option.

9. In the buildpacks select python pack first save it then repeat select nodejs pack and save it.

10. After this scroll up and select â€˜Deployâ€™ option.

11. In the â€˜deployâ€™ option select â€˜GitHubâ€™ option to select your project which one you want to deploy on Heroku, choose your project and connect to the Heroku.

12. After connecting your project to Heroku scroll down on Automatic Deploys button.

13. This will ensure whenever you change something in the repo and push the changes to GitHub, Heroku will rebuild the app. If you select this manually you can manually deploy options further down. For this project, I did Automatic Deployment to enable me to check changes I made to the app as I developed it.

14. Heroku will now build the app for you. Once it has completed the build process you will see a 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site.
